Auto-chat-using-jQuery
======================

This is a project I developed while learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery. 
It is a simple UI which can chat with you. It's functions are limited and it can only answer certain questions. 
It can answer following questions: 
  how are you, 
  what is the current time,
  where do you live, 
  where are you from, 
  where in,
  what do you eat, 
  what are your hobbies, 
  how do you look, 
  what is your age. 
  
Also, it can say bye bye...
