Auto-chat-using-jQuery
======================

This is a project I developed while learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery. <br/>
It is a simple UI which can chat with you. It's functions are limited and it can only answer certain questions. <br/>
It can answer following questions: <br/>
  <t>how are you, <br/>
  what is the current time,<br/>
  where do you live, <br/>
  where are you from, <br/>
  where in,<br/>
  what do you eat, <br/>
  what are your hobbies, <br/>
  how do you look, <br/>
  what is your age. <br/>
  
Also, it can say bye bye...
