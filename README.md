Auto-chat-using-jQuery
======================

This is a project I developed while learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery. <br/>
It is a simple UI which can chat with you. It's functions are limited and it can only answer certain questions. <br/>
It can answer following questions: <br/>
  1. how are you,
  2. what is the current time,<br/>
  3. where do you live, <br/>
  4. where are you from, <br/>
  5. where in,<br/>
  6. what do you eat, <br/>
  7. what are your hobbies, <br/>
  8. how do you look, <br/>
  9. what is your age etc...<br/>
  
Also, it can say bye bye...
